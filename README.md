This website attempts to answer the question - What's the weather like as we approach the equator? by providing visualizations of the possible relationships between the location of cities (considering full range of latitudes) and four environmental factors (temperature, humidity, cloudiness and windspeed). It contains individual webpage for each scatter plot and their corresponding explanations. This is achieved by using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
